# Default EVM version for each Solidity Compiler Version

## >= 0.8.20 - Shanghai
### Important Note
This compiler switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not yet support PUSH0, otherwise, deployment of your contracts will fail.

## >= 0.8.18 - Paris

## >= 0.8.7 - London

## >= 0.8.5 - Berlin

## >= 0.5.14 - Istanbul

## >= 0.5.5 - Petersburg

## >= 0.4.21 - Byzantium
### Important Note
you can now specify which EVM version the contract should be compiled for. Valid values are "homestead", "tangerineWhistle", "spuriousDragon", "byzantium" (the default) and "constantinople".
